# Quality-of-Red-Wine
<!-- Predicting the Quality of Red Wine using Machine Learning Algorithms for Regression Analysis, Data Visualizations and Data Analysis.
-->
<!--The data set is related to different red wine samples of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The quality of wine is scored between 0 (lowest) and 10 (highest). The objective of this project is to predict the wine quality using the wine properties provided in the data set.-->

The objective of this project is to predict the wine quality using the wine properties provided in the data set.
